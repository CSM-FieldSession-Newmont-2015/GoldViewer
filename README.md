See the work-in-progress demo [here](http://csm-fieldsession-newmont-2015.github.io/GoldViewer/).

You can also use Python to run a local server, which browsers demand when using external links, like jQuery.

With Python 3 (on port `8000`):
````
python -m http.server 8000
````

With Python 2:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

The page is then available at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
